## Linear Models Homework

Consider the `comic_characters` data that we encountered previously. 

1. Prepare the data by cleaning up the categories. 
    a. eye has some problems
    b. collapse categories in eye, hair and sex respectively. 

2.  Explore this data using the tools of `dplyr` and the `summarise()` function. 
3. Find out what things are most correlated. 
4. Perform univariate regressions. 
    a. Use glance to determine which has the strongest fit.
    b. Use glance to determine which has the weakest fit. 
5. Build a multivariate linear regression. 
6. With the model that lasso returns, fit a model using lm with the same covariates and them comment on how assumptions of linear regression were met.
